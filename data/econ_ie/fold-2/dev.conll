This O

the O
impact O
of O
the O
program B-coreference

different O
measures O
of O
empowerment B-outcome

Our O
results O

that O
some O
of O
the O

that O

been O
attributed O
to O
participatory B-intervention

are O
not O
the O
inevitable O

of O
mapping B-intervention

rather O
, O
they O
probably O
stem O
from O
other O
previous O
or O
ongoing O
processes O
that O
determine O
whether O

engage O
in O

how O

do O

. O
A O
key O
question O
is O
that O
of O

these O

innovative B-outcome
activities I-outcome
